    "The big issue with a game like Jeopardy is that a computer makes a poor Jeopardy judge. We're trying to do our best by using machine learning (Tensorflow) in order to get our AI, \\"Art Ificial Fleming\\" to get better at recognizing correct and incorrect responses.",
    "For example, computers might have a real problem recognizing that \\"!whois Henry Tudor\\" and \\"!whois Henry the 8th\\" are both acceptable answers for \\"!whois Henry VIII\\"",
    "Soon, we will have a website where human judges will be able to make real-time or near-real time corrections to what our AI does, (awarding points in those corrections) and hopefully (crosses fingers), Art will learn from them and get better over time, requiring less human intervention. In the meantime, please forgive Art's mistakes.  This is an in-dev, solo project.",
